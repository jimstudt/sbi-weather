My Raspberry Pi Pico weather station

## Salient Points

- There are many of these, this one is mine.
- It is my first pico project.
- It will use LORA to speak with an intermittently available gateway
  and store the observed data until it can be sent.
- Windspeed, direction, temperature, humidity, and pressure. I probably
  won't do rain, they just get plugged up in my environment.
- Build host is a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian. Plain old tools, nothing fancy.
- You can plug a console into the USB to configure and interrogate it.
